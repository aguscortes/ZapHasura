# HPDF T34NE1 | Zapier - New User Notification

We have implemented a project wherein it triggers a Zapier Zap. The aim is to create a user registration form and to create a zap for every new registration. We have created a Zap between Webhook + Google Spreadsheet + Gmail. This repository consists of both mobile app and web app built using Hasura.

## Frameworks Used
- **Frontend**
  - [React-Native](https://github.com/itssan14/ZapHasura/blob/master/README-ReactNative.md) (for mobile app)
  - [ReactJS](https://github.com/itssan14/ZapHasura/blob/master/README-ReactJS.md) (for web app)
- **Backend**
  - NodeJS-Express
  
## Functionalities
- A UI for users to sign up which captures details such as name, age, etc
- A custom sign-up service that uses the Hasura Auth API to sign-up a user and then triggers a Zapier Zap to update the newly signed up userâ€™s details into a Google Spreadsheet
- Post sign-up notifying the user that they have been successfully signed up along with a link to the Google Spreadsheet where the details have been captured.

## Procedure followed
1. **Created Zapier Zap**
